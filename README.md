## Problem Statement
Dota2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game, which is played in matches between two teams of five players occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each player(user) can independently control one powerful character(hero) who has unique abilities and skills.
Given dataset of professional Dota players and their most frequent 10 heroes, we need to build a model to predict the KDA ratio of specific user-hero pair.

The steps you need to do for final submission are shown below:
1. set the root path in dota2_DataManipulation.py
2. put the training, testing and submission data in root path
3. run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
4. run 'python dota2_DataManipulation.py'
5. get the submission file, submit.csv, on the root folder
